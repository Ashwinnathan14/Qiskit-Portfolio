Quantum Computing Fundamentals (Qiskit)
Overview

This repository contains a collection of foundational quantum computing examples implemented in Python using IBM Qiskit.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate core quantum computing concepts through hands-on circuit construction, simulation, and visualization.

This repository is intended as:

A technical portfolio for GitHub and LinkedIn
A foundation for more advanced quantum algorithms
